# Commuters

This repo contains a tidied up version of my code for exploring the role of commuters vs noncommuters in epidemics.
This is broadly split into 3 bigger pieces of work (bigger wrt code):

## Movement sampling

This investigates whether our current models for how commuters spread disease is consistent with how we think commuters
move.
The current hypothesis is that it is not, but that noncommuters largely fix the bias.

## Where do we take disease?

This will investigate what normalisations are valid in gravity models for epidemics.
The current step is investigating density dependence in data containing primarily commuting data vs non-commuting data.

## Grab that data

This is just a collation of data sources into one friendly interface I can rely on to get all the data in the same
format,
as well as document sources and interpretations for different datasets.
