# Movement sampling
This was the original plan to explore perfect vs random commuters, as it contained both models as special cases. The idea was then to use other distributions as less special-cases. After running both perfect and random sampling, parameter estimation was the same, and I found the paper by Keeling et al on random vs routine movement, which means going down the "choose a different sampling distribution" route was not it.
This was replaced by standard FOI meta-population models for speed, and then extended into bidirectional movement.
